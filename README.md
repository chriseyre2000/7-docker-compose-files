# 7-docker-compose-files
Docker Compose files for 7 databases in 7 weeks.

This covers 7 docker-compose files that allow you to work with 7 databases in 7 weeks without installing the databases locally.

This will also include sample connection details.
I intend to build examples in nodejs and if possible curl.
